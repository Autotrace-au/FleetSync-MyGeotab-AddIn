# FleetSync - How to Book Equipment

This guide explains how to book vehicles, trailers, and other equipment through Microsoft Outlook or Teams once the equipment mailboxes have been created.

---

## Overview

Each piece of equipment (vehicle, trailer, etc.) has its own email address and calendar. To book equipment, you simply invite the equipment's email address to a meeting, just like you would invite a colleague.

**Equipment Email Format:** `[serial-number]@[your-domain].com.au`

For example:
- `abc123@autotrace.com.au` (vehicle with serial ABC123)
- `trailer456@autotrace.com.au` (trailer with serial TRAILER456)

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use clear titles** so others know what the equipment is being used for
  - Good: "Site Visit - Brisbane CBD"
  - Bad: "Meeting"
- **Check availability** before booking to avoid conflicts
- **Book the right duration** - don't book for longer than you need

### ‚ùå Don't:
- **Don't book equipment "just in case"** - only book when you're sure you need it
- **Don't leave old bookings** - cancel them if plans change
- **Don't book beyond the maximum duration** - it will be rejected
- **Don't try to double-book** - it won't work (unless specifically allowed)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Your meeting conflicts with another appointment"
**Problem:** The equipment is already booked for that time.

**Solution:**
- Choose a different time slot
- Book different equipment
- Contact the person who has the current booking to see if they can change it

---

### "The booking was declined"
**Problem:** An approver rejected your booking request.

**Solution:**
- Contact the approver to understand why
- Try booking a different time or equipment
- Provide more details in your booking request

---

### "You cannot book this far in advance"
**Problem:** You're trying to book beyond the booking window (e.g., more than 90 days ahead).

**Solution:**
- Book closer to the date you need the equipment
- Contact your fleet manager if you need to book further ahead

---

### "The booking exceeds the maximum duration"
**Problem:** Your booking is longer than the maximum allowed (e.g., more than 24 hours).

**Solution:**
- Split your booking into multiple consecutive bookings
- Contact your fleet manager for extended use approval

---

### "I can't find the equipment in the address book"
**Problem:** The equipment mailbox might not be visible in the Global Address List.

**Solution:**
- Type the equipment's email address directly (e.g., `abc123@autotrace.com.au`)
- Contact your IT administrator to make the equipment visible in the address book
